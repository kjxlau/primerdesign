As part of a project from PSB academy, we plan to develop a series of python scripts to generate primers for Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification.

Step1_DownloadFasta.py Users will be prompted to enter (1) No of fasta entries to download, (2) Organism of interest or taxa ID from NCBI, (3) Countries of interest and (4) Filename to save in .fasta format

Users will need to then align the file using either clustalW or mafft multiple sequence aligment to generate an aligned sequence fasta file for Step 2.
